1.	In observation of the data, an interesting trend that stood out within the spending_df table. The table show the average scores of schools based grouped within the school’s budget spending per student. Surprisingly there appears to be a trend that the schools with the higher amount of spending per student have a lower “Overall Passing Rate” than schools with a lower per capita budget, on average passing approximately 73% of their students within the $645-675 range. This is in comparison to the two lowest budget ranges <$585 and $585 – 615 which both have a passing rate of approximately 95% of their students respectively. 

2.	The second trend as observed within the top_schools_df and bottom_schools_df, the tables that represent the highest performing and lowest performing schools based upon “Overall Passing Rate”. The trend observed, is that the top five schools are designated as all being Charter schools according to “School Type,” where as the bottom five schools are all designated as being District schools. This trend is further supported in the type_df table in which we can see that Charter schools on average are passing 95% of their students, in contrast to the District schools that only pass on average 73%  of their students.
